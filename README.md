# CGI Pipeline 

This pipeline is for various CGI DNA sequencing applications. 
Snakefiles, organized generally into various stages of analysis,
contain all the rules used to analyse libraries. 
Scripts, tools and binaries are under Data_and_Tools/tools, 
whereas Data_and_Tools/data (not on github) contains various databases and large datafiles.
